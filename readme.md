#Christmas Wordle

#Background 
This game is the Christmas themed version of the popular game 'Wordle'. 

#Instructions - general 
* There are 10 rounds in this game.
* Within each round, the player has 6 opportunities to guess the 'winning' word.
* The winning word is always a 5 letter word. 
* The winning word increases in difficulty throughout the game.
* The player will receive feedback on their guesses based on the letter status. 
* Letters will either appear as green, yellow or grey (on both the keyboard and the grid): 
    - A green letter indicates it is in the word and in the right position within the word. 
    - A yellow letter indicates it is in the word but in the wrong position.
    - A grey letter indicates it is not found anywhere in the word. 
* If a player has used all 6 guesses and has not identified the word, they have lost the game. 
* All players have the opportunity to reset the game at any stage, including if they have won the game. Clicking the reset button takes the player back to round 1 (the start of the game). 
* If a player correctly guesses the word, they should click the next round button to continue playing. 
* There are enter and backspace buttons. Enter should be used to submit a guess. Backspace will delete the last letter entered.
