#Background 
* This game is the Christmas themed version of the popular game 'Wordle'! 
* Wordle was created in October 2021 when a Welsh software engineer built the game for his partner during the pandemic. It grew from 90 daily players in November 2021 to over 2 million just two months later. 
* It remains a popular game, so grab a cup of cocoa and enjoy this festive edition. 

#Instructions
* There are 10 rounds in this game.
* Within each round, the player has 6 opportunities to guess the 'winning' word.
* The winning word is always a 5 letter word. 
* The winning word increases in difficulty throughout the game.
* The player will receive feedback on their guesses based on the letter status. 
* Letters will either appear as green, yellow or grey (on both the keyboard and the grid): 
    - A green letter indicates it is in the word and in the right position within the word. 
    - A yellow letter indicates it is in the word but in the wrong position.
    - A grey letter indicates it is not found anywhere in the word. 
* If a player has used all 6 guesses and has not identified the word, they have lost the game. 
* All players have the opportunity to reset the game at any stage, including if they have won the game. Clicking the reset button takes the player back to round 1 (the start of the game). 
* If a player correctly guesses the word, they should click the next round button to continue playing. 
* There are enter and backspace buttons. Enter should be used to submit a guess. Backspace will delete the last letter entered.

#Next Steps 
* To further develop this game some suggestions include: 

* Game play logic: 
    - Creating a more complex 'lose' logic. Introducing either a timer element or a lives element would likely improve the user experience as they would not need to reset the game entirely but could lose a life after 6 guesses instead. 
    - Additional instructions on the screen for the player. 

* Design element: 
    - Using media queries to evaluate this on different devices (phone, laptop etc). 
    - Increasing animation when tiles appear on the grid (for example turning or popping out at the player). 
    - Having a live animation appear on the final round, such as confetti falling down the page. 
    - Creating bespoke messages for every round a player passes rather than keeping it generic ('you are sleigh-in it').
